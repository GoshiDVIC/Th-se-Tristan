Although patient demographics, diagnostic techniques and therapeutic options considerably changed over time, the documented rationale on spinal injuries can still be regarded as the state-of-the-art reasoning for modern clinical practice.},

	abstract = {In medicine, a prosthesis (PL: prostheses; from Ancient Greek: πρόσθεσις, romanized: prósthesis, lit. 'addition, application, attachment'), or a prosthetic implant, is an artificial device that replaces a missing body part, which may be lost through trauma, disease, or a condition present at birth (congenital disorder). Prostheses are intended to restore the normal functions of the missing body part. Amputee rehabilitation is primarily coordinated by a physiatrist as part of an inter-disciplinary team consisting of physiatrists, prosthetists, nurses, physical therapists, and occupational therapists. Prostheses can be created by hand or with computer-aided design (CAD), a software interface that helps creators design and analyze the creation with computer-generated 2-D and 3-D graphics as well as analysis and optimization tools.},

Early field results indicate that users have not chosen to take control of these accessibility features from the Dynamic Keyboard, and that a variety of settings are being used. A more detailed ongoing study suggests that automatic adjustment of the key repeat delay feature is acceptable to users, while the debounce feature may not be appropriate for dynamic adjustment.},

	abstract = {With the recent advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is now possible to process a large number of sensor data streams using different large-scale IoT platforms. These IoT frameworks are used to collect, process and analyse data streams in real-time and facilitate provision of smart solutions designed to provide decision support. Existing IoT-based solutions are mainly domain-dependent, providing stream processing and analytics focusing on specific areas (smart cities, healthcare etc.). In the context of agri-food industry, a variety of external parameters belonging to different domains (e.g. weather conditions, regulations etc.) have a major influence over the food supply chain, while flexible and adaptive IoT frameworks, essential to truly realize the concept of smart farming, are currently inexistent. In this paper, we propose Agri-IoT, a semantic framework for IoT-based smart farming applications, which supports reasoning over various heterogeneous sensor data streams in real-time. Agri-IoT can integrate multiple cross-domain data streams, providing a complete semantic processing pipeline, offering a common framework for smart farming applications. Agri-IoT supports large-scale data analytics and event detection, ensuring seamless interoperability among sensors, services, processes, operations, farmers and other relevant actors, including online information sources and linked open datasets and streams available on the Web.},

	abstract = {World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 10\% of the global population has a disability, with social educational and/or economical consequences. Although such estimates have a weak basis (Metts, 2000; Eide and Loeb, 2006a) it might be about 600 million people around the world with special needs in terms of health care, education, rehabilitation, appropriate assistive devices and social support. Furthermore it is indicated that 80\% of people with disabilities live in low-income countries and also in very poor life conditions with limited access to health care services, rehabilitation and assistive devices. Case studies in developing countries show that higher disability rates are associated with higher rates of illiteracy, poor nutritional status, lower immunization coverage, lower birth weight, higher rates of unemployment and underemployment, and lower occupational mobility (Elwan, 1999). Disability can cause poverty by preventing the full participation of persons with disabilities in the economic and social life of their communities, especially if the appropriate supports and accommodations are not available. This chapter draws on results from recent studies on living conditions among people with disabilities in southern Africa (Eide et al. 2003a, b; Loeb and Eide, 2004; Eide and Loeb, 2006b) and aims at describing the situation for disabled people in low-income contexts with regards to assistive technology.},

There are different perspectives regarding the price and quality of health care, and it is necessary to review the quality health care issue and how it influenced by price. The aim of this study is to explore the different dimensions of health care quality, examine the association with technology, health care market characteristics, additional and optional services of health care, sustainability, and some exceptional situations. We performed the narrative review searching by key words by main search engine Google and followed by their mother publication and or any first web database. We found that health care is a service industry, needs basic standards and specialized human resources to perform the procedure, and quality health care is not associated with an extra price. The quality of health care assures sustainability. Likewise, there are some additional choices during certain procedures, and those may have different price options and would be linked with quality. So, those optional health care and basic health need to define separately.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on how to provide mobility to people with motor impairments with the integration of robotics and wearable computing systems. The burden of learning to control powered mobility devices should not fall entirely on the people with disabilities. Instead, the system should be able to learn the user's movements. This requires learning the degrees of freedom of user movement, and mapping these degrees of freedom onto electric-powered wheelchair (EPW) controls. Such mapping cannot be static because in some cases users will eventually improve with practice. Our goal in this paper is to present a hands-free interface (HFI) that can be customized to the varying needs of EPW users with appropriate mapping between the users' degrees of freedom and EPW controls. EPW users with different impairment types must learn how to operate a wheelchair with their residual body motions. EPW interfaces are often customized to fit their needs. An HFI utilizes the signals generated by the user's voluntary shoulder and elbow movements and translates them into an EPW control scheme. We examine the correlation of kinematics that occur during moderately paced repetitive elbow and shoulder movements for a range of motion. The output of upper-limb movements (shoulder and elbows) was tested on six participants, and compared with an output of a precision position tracking (PPT) optical system for validation. We find strong correlations between the HFI signal counts and PPT optical system during different upper-limb movements (ranged from r = 0.86 to 0.94). We also tested the HFI performance in driving the EPW in a virtual reality environment on a spinal-cord-injured (SCI) patient. The results showed that the HFI was able to adapt and translate the residual mobility of the SCI patient into efficient control commands within a week's training. The results are encouraging for the development of more efficient HFIs, especially for wheelchair users.},

	abstract = {Haptic technology (also kinaesthetic communication or 3D touch) is technology that can create an experience of touch by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user. These technologies can be used to create virtual objects in a computer simulation, to control virtual objects, and to enhance remote control of machines and devices (telerobotics). Haptic devices may incorporate tactile sensors that measure forces exerted by the user on the interface. The word haptic, from the Greek: ἁπτικός (haptikos), means "tactile, pertaining to the sense of touch". Simple haptic devices are common in the form of game controllers, joysticks, and steering wheels.
Haptic technology facilitates investigation of how the human sense of touch works by allowing the creation of controlled haptic virtual objects. Most researchers distinguish three sensory systems related to sense of touch in humans: cutaneous, kinaesthetic and haptic. All perceptions mediated by cutaneous and kinaesthetic sensibility are referred to as tactual perception. The sense of touch may be classified as passive and active, and the term "haptic" is often associated with active touch to communicate or recognize objects.},

For the field to move forward, many commercial and technological barriers need to be overcome. By rendering how objects feel through haptic technology, we communicate information that might reflect a desire to speak a physically- based language that has never been explored before.

Both experiments consisted of a user test, followed by answering a questionnaire. The results show tendencies of haptic feedback both increasing and inhibiting the ability to feel immersed by certain metrics, even if the statistical analysis shows no significant difference between the groups in any of the sub-scales. The results also show that most of the test subjects thinks that the vest and its’ haptic feedback delivers more immersion to the gaming experience. The conclusion that can be drawn from both experiments is that haptic feedback improves the user feeling of immersion, more specifically regarding the players awareness of the surroundings in the game.},

The first headset in the line was the Oculus Rift DK1, released on March 28, 2013. The last was the Oculus Rift S, discontinued in April of 2021.
The Rift went through various pre-production models prior to the release of the Oculus Rift CV1, the first Oculus Rift intended for use by the general public. Two of these, the DK1 in early-2013 and DK2 in mid-2014, were intended to provide content developers with a development kit platform to create content for the Rift's eventual consumer release. However, both development kits were purchased by many gaming enthusiasts who wished to get an early preview of the technology. The Rift saw its official consumer release in March 2016 with the Rift CV1, and was eventually replaced in March 2019 by the Oculus Rift S. The Oculus Rift software library is still compatible with its successor, the Oculus Quest.},

	abstract = {Effective haptic feedback in virtual reality (VR) is an essential element for creating convincing immersive experiences. To design such feedback, state-of-the-art VR setups provide APIs for programmatically generating controller vibration patterns. While tools for designing vibrotactile feedback keep evolving, they often require expert knowledge and rarely support direct manipulation methods for mapping feedback to user interactions within the VR environment. To address these challenges, we contribute a novel concept called Weirding Haptics, that supports fast-prototyping by leveraging the user’s voice to design such feedback while manipulating virtual objects in-situ. Through a pilot study (N = 9) focusing on how tactile experiences are vocalized during object manipulation, we identify spatio-temporal mappings and supporting features needed to produce intended vocalizations. To study our concept, we built a VR design tool informed by the results of the pilot study. This tool enables users to design tactile experiences using their voice while manipulating objects, provides a set of modifiers for fine-tuning the created experiences in VR, and allows to rapidly compare various experiences by feeling them. Results from a validation study (N = 8) show that novice hapticians can vocalize experiences and refine their designs with the fine-tuning modifiers to match their intentions. We conclude our work by discussing uncovered design implications for direct manipulation and vocalization of vibrotactile feedback in immersive virtual environments.},

	abstract = {As vibrotactile feedback systems become increasingly commonplace, their application scenarios are becoming more complex. In this article, we present a method of vibrotactor control that accommodates emerging design requirements, namely large vibrotactor arrays that are capable of displaying complex waveforms. Our approach is based on control through digital audio interfaces. We describe a new open-source software and hardware package, Syntacts, that lowers the technical barrier to rendering vibrations with audio. We also present a tutorial on common control schemes with a discussion of their advantages and shortcomings. Our software is purpose-built to control arrays of vibrotactors with extremely low latency. In addition, Syntacts includes means to synthesize and sequence cues, and spatialize them on tactile arrays. The Syntacts Amplifier integrates with the audio hardware to provide high-quality analog signals to the tactors without adding excess noise to the system. Finally, we present results from a benchmarking study with Syntacts compared to commercially available systems.},

With TactJam, designers can create, record and share vibrotactile patterns online. This opens up new ways of collaboratively designing vibrotactile patterns both in collocated as well as in remote settings. We evaluate TactJam in a two-part distributed online workshop, exploring the design of on-body tactons. Participants were able to successfully use TactJam to learn about tacton design. We present an overview of mappings between tactons and their associated concepts before comparing the results of tactons created using solely a GUI and tactons created through experimenting with placements directly on the body. Conducting both parts of the workshop separately highlighted the importance of designing directly with bodies: less implicit assumptions were made, and designs were guided by personal experience. We reflect on these results and close on deliberations for the future development of TactJam.},

	url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4154666},
	abstract = {The ability to mimic the tactile feedback exhibited by the human hand in an artificial limb is considered advantageous in the automatic control of new multifunctional prosthetic hands. The role of a slip sensor in this tactile feedback is to detect object slip and thus provide information to a controller, which automatically adjusts the grip force applied to a held object to prevent it from falling. This system reduces the cognitive load experienced by the user by not having to visually assess the stability of an object, as well as giving them the confidence not to apply unnecessarily excessive grip forces. A candidate for such a sensor is a thick-film piezoelectric sensor. The method of fabricating a thick-film piezoelectric slip sensor on a prototype fingertip is described. The construction of experimental apparatus to mimic slip has been designed and analyzed to allow the coefficient of friction between the fingertip and the material in contact with the fingertip to be calculated. Finally, results show that for a coefficient of friction between the fingertip and grade P100 sandpaper of approximately 0.3, an object velocity of 0.025plusmn0.008 ms
{\textless}sup xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}
 was reached before a slip signal from the piezoelectric sensor was able to be used to detect slip. It is anticipated that this limiting velocity will be lowered (improved) in the intended application where the sensor electronics will be powered from a battery, connections will be appropriately screened, and if necessary a filter employed. This will remove mains interference and reduce other extraneous noise sources with the consequence of an improved signal-to-noise ratio, allowing lower threshold values to be used in the detection software},

These patient groups typically suffer from decreased mobility and an increased incidence of injury due to fall, even with the application of prosthetic limbs. A haptic feedback system prototype was previously developed to provide augmentative sensory information to patients suffering from total or attenuated lower-limb sensory loss. By providing tactile cues to the user based on plantar pressure distributions, it is hoped that this system can improve rehabilitation and functional outcomes following lower-limb injury. This paper presents an updated system that was fitted to the residual limb of a below-knee amputee, as well as a pilot study using the device. The pilot study demonstrated that the amputee could accurately perceive various tactile stimuli with high accuracy (Gt 87.5\%), therefore indicating that the approach is feasible.},
